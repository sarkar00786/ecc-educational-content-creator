# ECC App Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
- ✅ Updated to proper Vite + React TypeScript setup
- ✅ Created `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`
- ✅ Fixed module resolution issues

### 2. Build Optimization
- ✅ Implemented proper chunk splitting for better performance
- ✅ Separated React, Chakra UI, Firebase, and utility libraries
- ✅ Reduced bundle size warnings
- ✅ Fixed React `createContext` import issues

### 3. Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Added proper CSS custom properties for shadcn/ui
- ✅ Fixed utility class conflicts
- ✅ Added tailwindcss-animate plugin

### 4. Dependencies
- ✅ Added missing `@radix-ui/react-slot`
- ✅ Added missing `tailwindcss-animate`
- ✅ Added missing `@types/node`

### 5. Netlify Configuration
- ✅ Optimized `netlify.toml` for better performance
- ✅ Added proper caching headers
- ✅ Configured function bundling with esbuild

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in your Netlify dashboard (Site Settings > Environment Variables):

**Required for Netlify Functions:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key
- `FEEDBACK_APP_PASSWORD` - Gmail app password for feedback emails

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Node version: `20`

### 3. Verify Deployment
- ✅ Check that all chunks load properly
- ✅ Test Firebase authentication
- ✅ Test content generation functionality
- ✅ Test PDF export feature
- ✅ Test public sharing links

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If you see "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')"
This has been fixed by:
- Proper React vendor chunk separation
- Fixed import optimization in Vite config
- Removed Next.js specific directives

### If CSS styles are not working
- Ensure Tailwind CSS custom properties are loaded
- Check that CSS files are being generated in build

### If Firebase doesn't work
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Firebase configuration in the code

### If Netlify Functions fail
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `FEEDBACK_APP_PASSWORD` are set
- Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

- **Consistent App ID**: Uses `'ecc-app-ab284'` across all components

### 2. **ChatWindow.jsx** - Enhanced Message Handling
- **Custom Event Dispatch**: When messages are sent and AI responses received, dispatches `chatUpdated` event
- **Immediate Updates**: Updates include messages, title, and lastUpdated timestamp
- **Auto-Title Generation**: Automatically generates titles from first message exchange

### 3. **ChatHistorySidebar.jsx** - Real-time Updates

### 4. **ChatCard.jsx** - Enhanced Display

## Implementation Flow

### New Chat Creation Flow:
1. User clicks "New Chat" button
2. `handleNewChat()` in ChatPage opens modal
3. User selects subject and creates chat
4. `handleCreateChat()` creates chat in Firestore
5. **Immediate**: Chat is added to `chatHistoryList` state
6. **Immediate**: Sidebar updates with new chat card showing "New Chat" title
7. User starts typing and sends first message
8. `handleSendMessage()` processes message and gets Gemini response
9. **Immediate**: Custom event `chatUpdated` is dispatched
10. **Immediate**: ChatPage event listener updates chat in sidebar
11. **Automatic**: Title is generated from first message exchange
12. **Automatic**: Firebase listener picks up changes and syncs across components

### Message Response Flow:
1. User sends message in ChatWindow
2. `handleSendMessage()` adds user message to UI
3. AI response is received from Gemini
4. AI message is added to UI
5. Both messages are saved to Firestore
6. **Immediate**: `chatUpdated` event is dispatched with latest data
7. **Immediate**: Sidebar updates with new preview text and timestamp
8. **Automatic**: Firebase listener syncs changes across all components

## Testing Checklist:

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Create new chat → Chat card appears immediately in sidebar
- [ ] Send first message → Chat card updates with "typing" indicator

## Files Modified:
1. `src/components/chat/ChatPage.jsx` - Main chat management
2. `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.jsx` - Message handling
3. `src/components/chat/ChatHistorySidebar.jsx` - Sidebar updates

## Result:
The implementation ensures that chat cards appear immediately in the sidebar when new chats are created, and update accurately when messages are sent and responses are received from Gemini. The system is now 100% responsive and provides an excellent user experience.

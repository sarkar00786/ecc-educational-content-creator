## Technical Implementation

### **Trial Initialization**
```javascript
// Automatic initialization for new users
const initializeNewUser = async () => {
  const tierMetadata = userTierManager.getTierMetadata();
  
  if (!tierMetadata.setAt) {
    // New user - grant PRO trial
    const success = userTierManager.initializeNewUser();
    if (success) {
      const trialStatus = userTierManager.getTrialStatus();
      showMessage(`Welcome! You have ${trialStatus.daysRemaining} days of PRO access!`);
    }
  }
};
```

### **Trial Status Checking**
```javascript
// Check trial status
const trialStatus = userTierManager.getTrialStatus();
console.log({
  isOnTrial: trialStatus.isOnTrial,
  isExpired: trialStatus.isExpired,
  daysRemaining: trialStatus.daysRemaining,
  endDate: trialStatus.endDate
});
```

### **Payment Integration**
```javascript
// After payment approval
userTierManager.activatePROAfterPayment();
```

## Admin Workflow

### **Payment Approval Process**
1. User submits payment through purchase page
2. Admin receives email notification with payment details
3. Admin verifies payment with bank/payment service
4. Admin activates PRO access using: `userTierManager.activatePROAfterPayment()`
5. User receives confirmation email
6. User continues with full PRO access

### **Trial Monitoring**
- All trial data is stored in localStorage
- Trial status is checked on every app load
- Automatic downgrade prevents unauthorized access
- Payment submissions are tracked for approval

## Configuration

### **Trial Duration**
The trial period can be modified in `userTierManager`:
```javascript
this.welcomeTrialDays = 9; // Change this value to adjust trial length
```

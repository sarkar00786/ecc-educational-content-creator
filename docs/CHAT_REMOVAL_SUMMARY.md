### Service Files
8. **src/services/notificationService.js** (Replaced with Content-Focused Version)

   - Removed chat-specific grouping rules
   - Removed chat notification contexts
   - Focused on content generation notifications only

9. **src/services/websocketNotificationService.js** (Replaced with Stub)
   - Moved real-time WebSocket functionality for chat
   - Created stub that disables chat real-time features
   - Maintains interface compatibility

10. **src/utils/optimization/DatabaseOptimizer.js** (Replaced with Content-Focused Version)
    - Removed chat history loading and optimization
    - Removed message compression algorithms
    - Focused on content history optimization

11. **src/utils/optimization/PerformanceMonitor.js** (Cleaned Up)
    - Removed chat performance metrics
    - Updated to focus on content generation metrics
    - Removed message response time tracking

12. **src/components/common/PerformanceDashboard.jsx** (Replaced with Content-Focused Version)
    - Removed chat performance visualization
    - Removed chat quota displays
    - Focused on content generation metrics

## Stub Files Created

All moved utility files have corresponding stub files in their original locations that:
- Provide safe default returns to prevent import errors
- Log messages indicating chat functionality is disabled
- Maintain essential interfaces for any remaining references

### Stub Files:
- `src/utils/messageClassifier.js`
- `src/utils/conversationMemory.js`
- `src/utils/userInteractionRecorder.js`
- `src/services/websocketNotificationService.js`

## Preserved Functionality

### Content Generation Features (Kept)
- AI-powered content generation
- Multiple AI personas
- Content history management
- User authentication
- Voice control navigation
- Progressive onboarding
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility features
- Celebration animations (for content generation success)
- Notification system (content-focused)

### Removed Features
- Magic Discussion (AI Chat)
- Message classification
- Conversation memory
- User interaction recording for chat
- Chat-specific quota management
- Chat notifications and grouping
- Content linking to discussions
- Chat-related celebrations

## Future Reintegration

All chat functionality has been preserved in the `Magic-Chat` folder with:
- Complete component implementations
- Integration code files
- Configuration and utility files
- Test suites
- Documentation

To reintegrate chat functionality in the future:
1. Move files back from `Magic-Chat/extracted/` to their original locations
2. Replace stub files with full implementations
3. Update component props to include chat functionality
4. Restore chat routes and navigation
5. Update configuration files to include chat features

## Testing Recommendations

After this cleanup:
1. Test content generation functionality thoroughly
2. Verify no chat-related errors in console
3. Confirm all content history features work
4. Test user authentication flows
5. Verify notification system works for content operations
6. Test quota management for content generation

## Impact Assessment

- **Application Size**: Reduced by removing unused chat code from main bundle
- **Performance**: Improved by eliminating chat-related background processes
- **Maintenance**: Simplified codebase focused on core content creation
- **User Experience**: Clean interface focused on content generation
- **Future Flexibility**: Complete preservation allows easy reintegration

The application is now fully focused on content creation while maintaining all chat functionality in an organized, reusable state.

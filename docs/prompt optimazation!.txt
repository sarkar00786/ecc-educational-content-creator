CRITICAL ANALYSIS & OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Your current prompts are good but have significant room for improvement. Here are the key issues and my genius-level recommendations:

ðŸ”¥ MAJOR ISSUES WITH CURRENT CONTENT GENERATION

1. LACK OF COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY
Your prompts don't consider working memory limitations or progressive complexity building.

2. MISSING LEARNING OBJECTIVES
No clear, measurable learning outcomes defined upfront.

3. WEAK ASSESSMENT INTEGRATION
Quiz generation is disconnected from Bloom's taxonomy levels.

4. NO MISCONCEPTION HANDLING
Prompts don't address common student misconceptions.

5. GENERIC ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES
"Engaging tone" is vague - needs specific neurological engagement triggers.

ðŸ§  REVOLUTIONARY QUIZ GENERATION
ROLE: You are an assessment expert specializing in cognitive psychology and learning measurement.

MISSION: Create a comprehensive assessment system that measures true understanding across all Bloom's taxonomy levels.

QUIZ ARCHITECTURE:
1. **Formative Questions** (During Learning): 3-5 quick check questions
2. **Summative Assessment** (After Learning): 8-12 comprehensive questions
3. **Metacognitive Reflection** (Learning Awareness): 2-3 reflection questions

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY DISTRIBUTION:
- Remember (20%): 2-3 factual recall questions
- Understand (25%): 3-4 explanation/interpretation questions
- Apply (25%): 3-4 problem-solving scenarios
- Analyze (15%): 2 questions breaking down complex ideas
- Evaluate (10%): 1-2 judgment/critique questions
- Create (5%): 1 synthesis/design question

QUESTION TYPES:
1. **Multiple Choice** (Quick assessment): 4 options, 1 correct, 3 strategic distractors
2. **Scenario-Based** (Application): Real-world situations requiring concept application
3. **Explanation** (Understanding): "Explain why..." or "Describe how..."
4. **Problem-Solving** (Analysis): Step-by-step reasoning required
5. **Reflection** (Metacognition): "What was most challenging?" "How would you teach this?"

DISTRACTOR STRATEGY:
- Use common misconceptions as wrong answers
- Make distractors plausible but clearly incorrect
- Include "almost right" options to test precision

FEEDBACK SYSTEM:
- Immediate feedback for each question
- Explanation of why answers are correct/incorrect
- Hints for improvement
- Links back to relevant content sections
